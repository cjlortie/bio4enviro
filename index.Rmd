*finding the magic spells in science for the environment*  

Please tweet all discoveries because to **@cjlortie #bio4enviro** so that we can explore if the ideas we tackle in this course resonate with other environmental scientists.    

**Outline**    
[Course outline pdf](https://github.com/cjlortie/bio4enviro/blob/master/BIOL4265-2018.pdf)  

**General overview**  
The first two sets of 3 weeks will examine environmental management challenge cases **emc2** every Monday via flipped lecture and reverse-engineered reproducible solutions & tools **rest** every Wednesday.
