![](./triwizard.jpg)  
<br>


For each environmental management challenge case examined, students will be responsible for completing the three questions provided here on emc2 Mondays (a total of 6).  These questions are direct preparation for the two tests (hint, hint) used to develop, consolidate, and evaluate critical environmental science thinking and problem solving associated with the first 3 learning outcomes for the course.
