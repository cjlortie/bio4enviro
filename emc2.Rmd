###Environmental management challenge cases    

For each environmental management challenge case examined, students will be responsible for completing the three questions provided here on emc2 Mondays (a total of 6).  These questions are direct preparation for the two tests (hint, hint) used to develop, consolidate, and evaluate critical environmental science thinking and problem solving associated with the first 3 learning outcomes for the course.

On practice days, it is recommended you complete questions 1 and 2 in full and for question 3 practice listing the solutions.  This is clearly explained in the form, and it is at your discretion to practice.  Discussion will be facilitated only on these 6 Mondays.
