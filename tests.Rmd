###Tests  

The emc2 & res practice form is the exact same as both tests.  It is the goal of this course to give you the opportunity to practice and then be tested on a novel, similar problem.  Simply reuse the form provide but APPLY to the test papers that will be posted here.

**Test form (same as practice form but complete Q3 in full)**  

[test form as word doc](https://github.com/cjlortie/bio4enviro/blob/master/BIOL4265_emc2.docx)  

[test form as PDF](https://github.com/cjlortie/bio4enviro/blob/master/emc2.pdf)  



**Test 1 publication:** [Direct and interactive effects of climate, meteorology, river hydrology, and lake characteristics on water quality in productive lakes of the Canadian Prairies](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0520#.W6U4zS-ZMWp)  

**Hint for primary tool:** [models - i.e. Modelling ecological systems in a changing world](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223798/)  

<br>  

**Test 2 publication:** [Modelling the niche space of desert annuals needs to include positive interactions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.04688)  

**Hint for primary tool:** [big data - i.e. Big data and the future of ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/120103)  

<br>  

**Note the marking key for citations:** if you use the above suggested rers tool for each test, and you are welcome to, you still need to find one more rers tool paper for that topic - i.e., for 'models' on first test and for 'big data' on second test.  


**Marking key**  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
key <- read_csv("key_tests.csv")
knitr::kable(key)

```
