###Reverse-engineered reproducible solutions  
![](./spells.jpg)  
<br>  

The rers (reverse-engineered reproducible solutions ) are your chance to find the magic in the science of the challenges we face and be creative.  I am hopeful that we can conceptualize the environmental problems that we collectively face into challenges with solutions. This component of the course addresses the second and fourth learning outcomes proposed - be able to develop solutions and appreciate the balancing act that is environmental management.  The first set of Wednesday lectures are directly associated with the reproducible, generalized solutions that science and people use for the magic of management. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and we can generate additional ideas.  We will read some of the contemporary literature describing new and powerful solutions to address environmental challenges, do better science, and at times provide solutions.
