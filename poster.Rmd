###Poster  
The final third of the course is an opportunity to explore, in depth, an environmental management challenge of their choice, do a meta-analysis, and present in a poster session (learning outcomes 5 & 6).  Meta-analyses are the gold-standard evidence-based decision making tool in most disciplines of science including health, clinical research, environmental science, and ecology and evolution. This is a group endeavour for sets of students with similiar interests to apply the emc2 and rers thinking to a topic of their choice, develop and present and analysis, and share with the class.
