###Poster  
The final third of the course is an opportunity to explore, in depth, an environmental management challenge of their choice, do a meta-analysis, and present in a poster session (learning outcomes 5 & 6).  Meta-analyses are the gold-standard evidence-based decision making tool in most disciplines of science including health, clinical research, environmental science, and ecology and evolution. This is a group endeavour for sets of students with similiar interests to apply the emc2 and rers thinking to a topic of their choice, develop and present and analysis, and share with the class.  

Nov 26th - poster session for students in class only. Poster 'due' this day - HOWEVER Malory and I will delay judging until the Weds Nov 28th.  The Nov 26th poster session will be for you to review and offer feedback to other group posters. You are absolutely welcome to revise from that advice but must provide, in person, the final poster for judging on Nov 28th.  

SUMMARY - this is a chance to get feedback, revise, and get an **automatic extension** from Nov 26 to the 28th if you would like to take advantage of it.  It also provides an opportunity to practice poster presentations and answering questions before you get graded.
